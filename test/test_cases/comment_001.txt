Comments:
  Lead 0: 
    All ST change episodes appeared to be rate-related non-ischemic
    episodes characterized by J-point depression and scooping of the
    ST segment.
  Lead 1:
    All episodes in lead 1 are compatible with heart-rate induced
    non-ischemic changes and are so labeled. It is recognized that
    this is an arbitrary decision.
  This record is from the initial Long-Term ST Database of
  eleven 24-hour ST annotated ambulatory records (record s20689).
